Jetstream Cashier Billing Portal is a simple scaffolding billing portal to manage subscriptions, built on top of Jetstream & Cashier Register.

Currently, only Inertia with Stripe are supported. For Paddle and/or Livewire, any PR is welcomed!

## ü§ù Supporting

Renoki Co. on GitHub aims on bringing a lot of open source projects and helpful projects to the world. Developing and maintaining projects everyday is a harsh work and tho, we love it.

If you are using your application in your day-to-day job, on presentation demos, hobby projects or even school projects, spread some kind words about our work or sponsor our work. Kind words will touch our chakras and vibe, while the sponsorships will keep the open source projects alive.

## üöÄ Installation

This package assumes you have installed Jetstream in your project. If not, head over to [Jetstream website](https://jetstream.laravel.com) for installation steps.

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require renoki-co/jetstream-cashier-billing-portal
```

You shall install the Cashier Billing Portal in one command, just like Jetstream. This will install Cashier, Cashier Register and Billing Portal.

```bash
$ php artisan billing-portal:install
```

Next up, you should use the [custom Cashier Register trait](https://github.com/renoki-co/cashier-register#preparing-the-model) instead of Cashier's one for your billable model.

```php
use RenokiCo\CashierRegister\BillableWithStripe;

class User extends Model
{
    use BillableWithStripe;

    //
}
```

You will also have to [prepare the plans](https://github.com/renoki-co/cashier-register#preparing-the-plans) in `CashierRegisterServiceProvider`.

Import the created `app/Providers/CashierRegisterServiceProvider` class into your `app.php`:

```php
$providers = [
    // ...
    \App\Providers\CashierRegisterServiceProvider::class,
];
```

In `CashierRegisterServiceProvider`'s boot method you may define the plans you need:

```php
use RenokiCo\CashierRegister\CashierRegisterServiceProvider as BaseServiceProvider;
use RenokiCo\CashierRegister\Saas;

class CashierRegisterServiceProvider extends BaseServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Boot the service provider.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function boot()
    {
        parent::boot();

        // Define plans here.
    }
}
```

## üôå Usage

The package is all about the scaffolding a billing portal for your app.

For more information about plans and quotas, check [Cashier Register Documentation](https://github.com/renoki-co/cashier-register) and [Laravel Cashier for Stripe](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/billing).
